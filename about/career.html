											<h3>EniWARE (Jan 2019 - Jun 2020)<br>Junior Network Administratir</h3>
											<p>My internship in EniWARE was full of excitements,
											hours of reading and researching and valuable practices
											and pieces of advice. People there taught me virtualization,
											how to work with Linux and the basics of networking.
											I had the opportunity to gain experience with real servers
											and got familiarised with LoRaWAN technology.</p>
