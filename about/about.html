									<p>I am a young Cyber Security enthusiast and student.
									I am highly interested in Networking, Programming, Vulnerability
									Analysing, Web Hacking, etc. I have gained my experience through many
									pieces of research related to CTFs, course work, a better understanding
									of my university modules. Other contributing factors are personal
									interest and hunger for new knowledge.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>I have been interested in the technology field since I started
									learning programming in C++ in high school. However, my interest in
									cybersecurity began after I read the book "The Anonymous. Remember the 5th of November"
									by Edouard Brasey. Since then, I have been learning more and more about
									Penetration Testing, Cyber Security Analysis, etc.</p>

							<h2>CTFs</h2>
							<p>One of the best methods of learning and practising cybersecurity for me are CTFs.</p>
						</header>
						<p>Most of the time, I use platforms like Hack The Box (HTB), TryHackMe (THM) and VulnHub.
						But I am also interested in Blue Team CTF platforms like BlueTimeCTF. Furthermore, I have had
						participated in a couple of CTFtime events.</p>

						<p>My professional technical experience is in networking, network maintaining,
