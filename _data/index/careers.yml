    detail: As part of my university course, I have been given the opportunity to take part in a placement year. Due to me already working for CyberSift over the past 10+ months, I have decided to continue my work. I have made this decision based on my wiling to learn more from my team and mentors. Moreover, loyalty is a fundamental value that I hold close, and I would like to see and participate in the growth of the company.
